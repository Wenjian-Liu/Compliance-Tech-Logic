## Travel Mode · Java Learning Log

### 📌 Learning Focus
- Watched Heima Java OOP video: **Access Modifiers (权限修饰符)**

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Reviewed four access levels: `private`, default (package-private), `protected`, and `public`.
- Understood access scope differences across:
  - Same class
  - Same package
  - Subclass
  - Different package
- Reinforced encapsulation principles:
  - Fields should generally be `private`.
  - External access should be provided via controlled methods (getters/setters).
- Clarified practical use cases for `protected` in inheritance scenarios.

### 💻 Practice
- No new code written today.
- Concepts applied to previously implemented OOP examples (Product hierarchy, Salary demo).

### 🌍 Notes
- Travel mode day focused on consolidating OOP fundamentals.
- Strengthened understanding of visibility control and class design boundaries.

✅ Daily check-in completed.
