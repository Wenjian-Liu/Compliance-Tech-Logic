# Day24 – 2025/12/21  
## Java Learning Log

### 📌 Learning Focus
- Heima Java video: **OOP – Utility Class (工具类)**

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- A utility class groups reusable, stateless helper methods (typically `static`).
- Common design patterns:
  - Use `private` constructor to prevent instantiation.
  - Expose functions via `public static` methods.
- Example practiced (concept-level):
  - Degrees ↔ Radians conversion.

### 💻 Practice
- No coding today (did not open the laptop).
- Focused on understanding utility-class structure and typical usage scenarios.

### ✅ Notes
- Will implement the degree/radian converter as a small utility class when back on coding mode.
