Topic: Collections — 3 traversal methods (Iterator / enhanced for / Lambda)

Status: ✅ Done

What I learned / practiced
- Iterated a Collection using:
  - Iterator
  - Enhanced for-loop
  - Lambda `forEach`
- Teacher explained parts of source code; I followed the idea but haven't fully understood the internals yet.
- Briefly introduced method reference `::`; parked for later (will revisit when learning Lambda & method references systematically).

Output
- Implemented 3 Java demo files for the three traversal approaches.
